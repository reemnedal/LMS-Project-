== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where do I buy add-ons or bundles for my LifterLMS eLearning Website?

You can explore the individual learning management system add-ons [here](https://lifterlms.com/store/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) or save BIG with a [bundle](https://lifterlms.com/product-category/bundles/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale)


#### How do I troubleshoot issues with my LMS website?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS plugins active on your site, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure theyâ€™re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### How do I ask a question about my online course website?
